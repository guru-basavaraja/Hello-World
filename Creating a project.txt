NodeJs setup

1.Initialize Your Node.js Project:

npm init -y

2.Install Dependencies:

Since we're using Express.js for our server, install it along with any other dependencies you might need. 

npm install express

3.Create Your Express Server:

Create a file named index.js in your project directory.
Open index.js in your code editor and add the following code to create a basic Express server:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});


4.Run Your Application Locally:

node index.js

Run node index.js in your terminal to start your Node.js server locally.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your "Hello, World!" message.

5.Commit Your Changes:

Once you're satisfied with your Node.js application, commit your changes to your Git repository:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add basic Express server for Hello World app"
git remote add origin https://github.com/guru-basavaraja/Hello-World.git
git push -u origin main

---------------
Creating docker file


1.Create a Dockerfile



# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your application's code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run your application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]


2.Build Your Docker Image


docker build -t hello-world-nodejs .

3.test locally

docker run -p 3000:3000 hello-world-nodejs
